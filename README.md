# First Mark RESTful PHP

Build a PHP RESTful with fastest Web micro-framework in the world!

## Features of this project and code-base

- Mark: Web micro-framework
- Medoo: Easy database functionality
- Mariadb: Database
- Some useful function to check body and input of your routes
- Unit-Tests with **Python** scripts
- Optimized and clean Database tables ([database.sql](database.sql))

By the way, I think it's good to package if you want to easily and fast go up.

## What is Mark?

Mark is a high performance micro framework based on [workerman](https://github.com/walkor/workerman) helps you quickly write APIs with php.

Probably the fastest PHP web framework in the world. See [the-benchmarker](https://web-frameworks-benchmark.netlify.app/result?asc=0&order_by=level512).

## Routes of this example project

```
// Main routes
$api->post('/v2/verification[/]', function ($request) {}
$api->post('/v2/sign-in[/]', function ($request) {}
$api->post('/v2/guest[/]', function ($request) {}

// Old just to test
$api->any('/', function ($request) {}
$api->post('/user/create', function ($request) {}
$api->get('/hello/{name}[/]', function ($request, $name) {}
```

## But Why it's fastest in the world?

All of your functions, variables, and global variables will be parsed and ready before getting user requests.
And it's why this micro-framework is the fastest.

> I used PHP 8, And PHP runs code using its JIT. So I guess this will be fastest then when I decide to write a Restful in C or cpp.

Remember your script will be running always and you do not have to stop it. And keep running a database connection maybe cause some errors and problems.
And if you want to launch this project in production, you have to configure your database server.
